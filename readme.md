# Playlist Maker for Stockholm Trekkers
[Stockholm Trekkers](https://www.stockholmtrekkers.se/stockholm-trekkers-english/) is an nonprofit organization that brings Star Trek enjoyers together.

### Why?
The organization regularly organizes events where we watch Star Trek episodes and movies together. To watch these episodes that we choose in advance, we need to have a playlist ready. This program helps us to create a playlist of episodes.

### How?
This desktop apps makes it easy to compile the required episodes into a playlist. You select the episodes from your local hard drive and set the start time for the episodes. The program inserts pauses in between groups of episodes to allow for breaks in the schedule. At the end you export the playlist as a folder that that you place on a USB drive which you bring to the [Trekdag](https://www.stockholmtrekkers.se/trekdagar/) to play. The folder contains the episodes you chose, the pause files (video clips of our logo) and a file called play.ps1. When you run the play.ps1 file, it will play the episodes with [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). After you have started it you can leave it running and it should handle everything for you.

### A nerdier how?
This [electron app](https://www.electronjs.org/) makes it easy to make your playlist with local files. It downloads the pause files (animations of our logo) which are ~400MB. The rest of the assets, i.e. the episodes, are provided by you. It exports a folder that contains all of the episodes in one sub-folder, the pause files in another sub-folder and a powershell script. The ps1 file is called play.ps1 and is a control script for [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). It gets procedurally generated by the electron app (via JavaScript) and it uses VLCs extensive command line [interface API](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help/) to play the episodes. The script uses the system clock to determine when to play the next episode so it is never dependant on when the playlist was started.

### How to install?
Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/viggoStrom/Stockholm-Trekkers-Playlist-Maker/releases) page on GitHub and choose the latest version and open the *Assets* dropdown. Download the installer file (.msi for windows) and run it. It installs the program locally and will the prompt you to download additional files. The additional files are the pause files which are roughly 400MB. After installation the program will be installed so you can launch it from the start menu.
