#### Legend
[ ] - Unfinished.
[X] - Finished.
[-] - Partial or rejected.

## Changes
- [-] make console.* more verbose. Maybe extend them?
  - [ ] Refactor and make main and renderer versions more consistent.
- [ ] Actually recolor icons to color-fg instead of filters since filters affect the outline.
- [X] Handle openFilePath that leads to a non-existent folder.
  - [X] Error dialog.

## Features
- [ ] Remove video assets on uninstall. Now that the installer is NSIS this should be possible.
- [X] handle another persons imported project
  - [X] It will prompt you if any files are missing.
  - [-] maybe prompt to find the project output folder if it can't find your files
- [-] self signed cert.
- [ ] Import a text file that will act as an overlay to easily make the playlist.
- [ ] Keep track of progress throughout an episode while the playlist is playing for seamless play in case of disruptions. 
- [ ] Move blocks around in the editor.
  - [ ] Drag and drop mayhaps?
  - [X] Currently doable in the json file
- [ ] makePS1 could be on a worker thread or at least be async.
- [-] Allow playlist to roll over midnight, currently it just tries to wait for 24:45 or whatever so it won't play. In the episodeTimes.js file you could the times over in the secondsToHhmm() function but then it would wait for that time regardless of the date. E.g. if it rolls over and the time is set to 1:45, it would theoretically play at 1:45 that morning morning.
  - [X] That behavior is fine i guess, better than times after 23:59 not playing at all.
  - [ ] Handle rollover more robustly in the ps1 file by reading the date but for now it's fine.

## Fixes
- [-] What happens when you don't have disk space?
  - [-] After a pretty long while you get an error in windows telling you it's full. Not optimal but still, it's something. Not sure about linux behavior.
  - [X] There is a text warning before exporting that won't prevent you but it might help.
- [X] What happens when the program closes mid download?
  - [X] If you don't have all the files, it will delete the folder before downloading them all again. And in addition, when downloading, all files are .crdownload so that won't count as that unfinished file.
- [X] Have a look at all validator code
  - [X] Time validator for duplicate time only tags one at a time and removing all the non tagged times does not resolve the popup even though it should.
  - [X] Validators do not get resolved on block deletion

## Patches 

## Easter Eggs
- [X] first contact date in the validator.
- [X] 47! in the time validator.
