## Changes
###### changes to existing -functional- features

## Features
###### brand new features
- [ ] Remove video assets on uninstall. Now that the installer is NSIS this should be possible.
- [X] handle another persons imported project
  - [X] It will prompt you if any files are missing.
  - [-] maybe prompt to find the project output folder if it can't find your files
- [-] self signed cert.
- [ ] Import a text file that will act as an overlay to easily make the playlist.
- [ ] Keep track of progress throughout an episode while the playlist is playing for seamless play in case of disruptions. 
- [ ] Move blocks around in the editor.
  - [ ] Drag and drop mayhaps?
    - [ ] There's an html API for that so it is very doable and since the saving is done in the DOM order it should be as simple as moving the blocks.
  - [X] Currently doable in the json file
- [-] makePS1 could be on a worker thread or at least be async.
  - [X] Really not necessary, it's basically just concatenating strings.
- [-] Allow playlist to roll over midnight, currently it just tries to wait for 24:45 or whatever so it won't play. In the episodeTimes.js file you could the times over in the secondsToHhmm() function but then it would wait for that time regardless of the date. E.g. if it rolls over and the time is set to 1:45, it would theoretically play at 1:45 that morning morning.
  - [X] That behavior is fine i guess, better than times after 23:59 not playing at all.
  - [ ] Handle rollover more robustly in the ps1 file by reading the date but for now it's fine.

## Fixes
###### structural or more complex fixes
- [-] What happens when you don't have disk space?
  - [-] After a pretty long while you get an error in windows telling you it's full. Not optimal but still, it's something. Not sure about linux behavior.
  - [ ] Try to reserve space? Calculate space requirements first?
  - [ ] This applies to both downloading and exporting. Downloading does give an error less catastrophically than exporting.  
  - [X] There is a text warning before exporting that won't prevent you but it might help.
- [ ] Actually recolor icons to color-fg instead of filters since filters affect the outline.
